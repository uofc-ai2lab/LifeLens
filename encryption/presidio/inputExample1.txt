okay can see jugular veins but don't seem it descended uh any pain in your chest a little on the lower side on this side side over here so it expose I'd cut and expose I'd probably just lift up in honesty if we're inside in the cold today if it's minus5 or whatever so see look at his chest see if I see anything look at his chest okay take a nice deep breath for me and of course we'll expose them once we get them somewhere as warm as deep breath okay does that hurt at all no what bit over here when I push here it hurts uh just a little yeah okay it looks bruised on that side I don't to no anything else uh any pain in your um abdomen at all no no okay nice deep breath in and out of your mouth and it and in just breathe in and through your nose and just listen to your heart okay okay everything sounds Hollow good equal air entry everywhere and he's got pain over in that side no pain in your belly at all no okay just going to push on your belly that doesn't hurt you at all okay any pain in your hips uh no really okay where's your legs hurt uh this one right here just that one yeah okay um we just kind of cut so I cut his pants tear up the side see let's say that we see some deformities if it seems deform uh so hurts when I do this yeah okay knee hurt it all around your knee uh no okay what about down your leg here no okay on this side no okay I'm going to compare color movement sensation we'll take his boot off once we get in the truck we'll probably take both off and look for pulses in this leg particularly because I want to get a traction splin on it but we're going to get going with them so let's say four seconds both side can you feel me as I'm touching your leg which leg am I touching touch my right one okay left left okay wiggle can you wiggle your toes for me okay good okay let's uh get them going we're going to get a collar on so get collar on this will free you up do you want to grab our backboard and we'll SL this over so we could have had this been available I could have delegated to go grab the collar and we could have got somebody put the collar on and uh got Maggie's hands freed up for us to be of assistance but I didn't do that so we didn't okay we're going to I'd snug this up pretty tight is that for is that her the bre so i' snug that up pretty tight I'm leaving a little bit loose for his sake too long enough here Force we get them on the scoop stretcher your arm beside I know that leg's real sore we're going to try to be gentle with it as we try to get that apart did you get and and would size it first it's just locked in place so once these so we got to push those back oh we're too far so here put her back together it's just way easier to put it the same size so go through the M like this and slide together just jiggle uh we want to come in the first one so once you pull it once you put these straight as soon as it comes to a spot where there's a hole it'll pop in okay so we're a bit we're long enough for okay we'll take it apart and we'll take that side we usually wouldn't lift over him we come just lift and not put it anywhere so we can drop it on his face in we're just going to bring your legs together can you just pull we're just going to pull this leg down I know that hurts okay you just hold his feet like that I'm just going to grab for the time being just hold his feet together um we will okay okay okay we're going to clip this feet together first for anything else so if you can clip that together got that together okay so if you want to come on up here I'm just going it's not quite okay we'll just work on bringing this in a little bit I if you hold this head we're just going to roll them a little tiny bit I'm just going to take the weight out of his arms here you let me know when we're going to roll them over on three I'm just going to move them ever so slightly so you can slide that in over towards okay three one two three okay okay let me click this one first yeah we're clicked here now up there yeah I'm just going to okay plant them together pinching you any worse no okay so let's get them strapped in so with these here normally you'd have this scoop stretcher doesn't have any um any Clips on it normally there would be clips uh that you can clip in the other option is you can Loop the belt around and loop it into itself okay so let's Loop them let's go ahead and tie them on the short little ends are annoying you might not get them to go on for the time being um but we'll just pretend so if you have broken ribs you strap them over broken we're going to have to hold them we try to avoid as best we can you just leave your armit like that we don't need his arm so we just come over and grab uh if you leave if you have the buckles if there's a longer one with a buckle if there's a short Buckle put the buckle down by his hip I mean like this rather than up over his shoulder it's quite uncomfortable over his shoulder okay you want to wrap that around and put that on the Belt itself if you know what I mean and this one's going to be annoying is it not going that's okay I can immute at work by hooking on a piece of metal which is an ideal which is an ideal but ideal does not what happen either still work just take a deep breath for me how you doing Danny okay okay like to add this down a little further do you want to go grab the stretcher meie yeah sit in the hall there we'll going we'll get going with him just deep breath for me Danny you doing okay there Danny not having any more trouble breathing no just at the same Cross Your Arms over your chest okay we're going to lift y on up uh so we'll just lift up on the stretcher we're going to lower it halfway down so we just lift right here squeeze the handle and lower down halfway go halfway up up a little higher watch second set it down set it down now squeeze the handle lift there like go there perfect so we're going to lift up the two of us should be able to we'll do a two person lift down at the head here uh one person there will get a bystander come hold the stretcher okay and if mag if you want to grab the feet we're going to grab the Torso you just we're going to be able to uh step over the stretcher so you'll just have to stay at the head don't come to the side okay are you ready Maggie you good there on three one two three up we go okay and let's get them strapped in so the Torso straps so we do legs and abdominal is straight forward torso straps uh bring the shoulder straps up don't tighten them first tighten the strap across first so just lift your arms up in the air Danny for a second yeah perfect how you doing good so tighten this strap first so pull tight here and then pull tight here okay then it doesn't end up around his neck okay so we'd lift up we go off to the stretcher go off to the stretcher um and we might uh if we had oxygen on he's breathing okay right now he doesn't seem cobic doesn't seem in extreme respirator distress we'll get him in the truck and see how he's doing so let's say he's in the truck I'm just going to grab a chair mie's going to drive grab yourself a chair to go with the heads Oh no you're coming you're coming in the truck with me you're very kind and Maggie's off right okay how you doing Dan okay okay so I'm going to reassess the level of Consciousness Airway breathing any is your breathing getting any worse no not at all no okay uh I'm just going to grab my S2 monitor which is sitting on the bench you noticed I didn't take the monitor onto the trauma scene I'd like to avoid that if at all possible so grab SP2 and nip you're really quick supposed to be really quick I'm going stick this I asb2 on the opposite finger of nibp so it's not every time takes a blood pressure interfering with my SP2 going to put a blood pressure cup on your arm if you don't mind and I'll turn it's it's set I'll do my nibp and I'll set it to go every every five minutes here once we go so I'm going to cue every five minutes is what I'm going to do for his blood pressure so we got a heart rate which will'll be up in a second SP2 is coming up at 98% heart rate of uh we'll say 120 uh stay for the Sunbeam uh so we're good you having any trouble breathing at all just that soreness in your chest down there and your leg down here okay so now I'm going to address his femur that's addressed so because he could be bleeding there I'm going to address that at this time so we're going to what's our time on the video 1420 okay good just don't want it to trickle over 20 minutes okay thanks for coming along Blake really appreciate problem your expertise lover firefighters in our region lovely feel pretty useful okay pardon feeling pretty useful up here well you're you're you're here if I if you need you I'm just going to splint his leg um and great to have an extra set of hands if he gets sick sicker on SS good okay so the first thing I'm going to unbuckle uh so reassess love conscious a ABC uh I'd love to get an IV if I had another set of trained hands that could start an IV in on but I'm going to elect to put the traction splint on first as we go just going to un oh problem solving well done uh so uh I'm just going to expose this leg here now uh if we haven't already depending if it was cold outside or not cut uh and uh rip up the side uh cut uh expose both legs I'd look at both see what color looks like in both legs note any bruising deformities over the site uh can you going to get his going to get his um going to get his boots off these boots if I was honest I'd just cut a shoelaces but today we'll not cut a shoelaces just thank you I just have a little hook that I'll just hook and Pull and it'll pull pull through everything and we'll be done we're going to P stabilize his leg and pull his boot off both legs because I want to compare his feet and his pulses what if like they say like don't cut it or something oh they usually gets more Cooperative I tell them I'm going to have to cut this your foot your your legs broken and usually they're in enough pain they don't care okay I pull his socks off we'll just leave your socks there yeah okay so just going to going to feel uh P pulses do I have okay pet pulse in both I look at cap refill and color in both looks similar can you feel this Danny mhm okay um so can you feel that sharp as well yeah at this side y okay wiggle your toes so we got good intact CMS for the time being we're just going to put a splint on this leg over here it looks like you have your you broke the big bone in your leg your femur that's why that's hurting so bad um and this sock would be let's just pretend that sock's off I'll just pull it up the um so uh that's why that's hurting in the middle of your thigh okay we're just going to put a splint on that which will help that feel a lot better that right with you Danny yeah so when this spint comes right up between your legs kind of like a unicycle I want to be make make sure that I don't get on your genitalia at all okay so if you don't mind can you reach your hand down and just make sure your penis is out of the way your genital is completely I know it's a great day forget to bring I love you bent your leg you wouldn't do that for your leg okay can you just help me I go up there is that okay there y now it's crushing no okay so I'm going to slide this strap up along the side of his leg to hold that in place and we'll make sure this is in the right spot because it's going to put some pressure up there up into your sit bones and I don't want that to get on any anything that we don't that would cause pain okay remember this is only for a mid fracture maybe proximal often won't go on proximal but definitely not anything near the knee um I love that my my scoop stretcher is going to be in the way he's fairly stable so we might take the scoop stretcher off okay so we tighten up our strap which of course is caught up in my velro Sor to be wiggling you here so much Danny in okay so that's in the right spot up there in your groin okay so we're going to hold that firmly there and we're going to pull it on the splint till we get a big 10 pounds of pressure 10% of their body weight should work to pull that out does that help a lot does that feel more comfortable in your thigh yeah is that too tight on your can you tolerate that for a few minut okay so that's a 10 so we're just going to strap your legs together make sure that leg doesn't move around now okay how far away are we from hospital what time is it oh uh it's at 20 minutes 20 minutes okay we're going to ready to the hospital after I get this on how you doing there Danny good is that okay there that's not as you can Pat on either side if that pulls his knee that's pulling his leg and weird that pinch it all Danny no okay so we're going to now I'm going to turn my attention I'm going to come back and look at my blood pressure again has that been going off every five minutes hasn't g off yet no okay we'll get our nibp going and uh going to look at his vital sense I'm going to go and get an large bore IV and I'm going to call the hospital okay uh once I get a blood pressure uh back here I'll grab my stuff from I large 4 IV i' look and see what he's got available and we'll get go from there he's got a blood pressure 126 and 78 got a heart rate of 130 so that's a softish blood pressure given his heart rate but we're just going to start IV and get going or we're on route to hospital start IV just in case we're concerned so I'd look Danny's got great veins so I'd probably put in 18 uh to start off and probably go something bigger in his AC uh once we get going because he's got lots of nice veins in his hand so it started off a little a little bit more conservative in his hand to make sure that I could get something and then I'd go to something a little larger up in his AC probably in his opposite arm and the same arm is the blood pressure be yeah it'll be fine um well either or whatever vein I can switch the blood pressure cup over as I need to but it will slow down for the few moments so I call it a hospital say hi Q uh this is uh Island EMS
