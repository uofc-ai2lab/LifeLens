So we are going to facilitate a trauma scenario now.
So you can see we have a mannequin on the floor with blankets.
The blankets are supposed to be snow.
It's not really snow, but we're hoping it's just enough to get our participants in that mindset to go with it.
Okay, so these are the vital signs.
And really the point of this scenario is for our responders to respond to the scene, perform an assessment.
And what they're going to find is that the patient has a pneumo.
I'll show you that again.
Clicking on the lungs, and then clicking on pneumothorax, I can then choose which side.
So I'm going to give them a right-sided pneumo, and then activate.
There might be some other injuries that are hard to simulate using the mannequin.
So as the facilitator, I will be verbalizing what those are if the participants actually assess them or look for those things.
OK.
