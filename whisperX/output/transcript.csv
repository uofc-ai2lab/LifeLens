00:00:00.217,00:00:02.839,So we are going to facilitate a trauma scenario now.
00:00:03.319,00:00:06.262,So you can see we have a mannequin on the floor with blankets.
00:00:06.283,00:00:07.884,The blankets are supposed to be snow.
00:00:08.224,00:00:15.092,"It's not really snow, but we're hoping it's just enough to get our participants in that mindset to go with it."
00:00:15.913,00:00:17.614,"Okay, so these are the vital signs."
00:00:18.256,00:00:25.042,"And really the point of this scenario is for our responders to respond to the scene, perform an assessment."
00:00:25.503,00:00:29.126,And what they're going to find is that the patient has a pneumo.
00:00:29.393,00:00:30.074,I'll show you that again.
00:00:30.114,00:00:36.362,"Clicking on the lungs, and then clicking on pneumothorax, I can then choose which side."
00:00:36.563,00:00:39.447,"So I'm going to give them a right-sided pneumo, and then activate."
00:00:40.527,00:00:44.152,There might be some other injuries that are hard to simulate using the mannequin.
00:00:44.192,00:00:52.064,"So as the facilitator, I will be verbalizing what those are if the participants actually assess them or look for those things."
00:00:53.265,00:00:53.445,OK.
00:00:54.286,00:00:55.148,Chart 53.
00:00:56.173,00:01:00.500,"27-year-old male, ATV rollover, no helmet, County Road 1643."
00:01:00.560,00:01:01.401,"Time now, 1430."
00:01:01.521,00:01:04.004,"Roger that, we're on it."
00:01:04.284,00:01:15.060,Hello!
00:01:16.542,00:01:18.944,"Alright, DSI, scene safe."
00:01:21.388,00:01:24.072,Looks like we have a 27-year-old male.
00:01:25.790,00:01:26.611,Unresponsive.
00:01:26.631,00:01:27.311,"Sir, can you hear me?"
00:01:27.331,00:01:28.875,My name is Hans with the ambulance service.
00:01:28.894,00:01:29.635,"My partner, Ted."
00:01:29.656,00:01:30.417,"Can you hear me, sir?"
00:01:32.359,00:01:33.221,Can you hear me?
00:01:33.240,00:01:33.662,Unresponsive.
00:01:33.682,00:01:34.563,Let's get to the vitals here.
00:01:34.582,00:01:36.064,I'm going to start checking for any injuries.
00:01:38.688,00:01:40.751,"My pen light, shiny eyes."
00:01:41.031,00:01:41.894,Pupils react to light?
00:01:42.274,00:01:44.757,Pupils are reactive to light.
00:01:44.778,00:01:48.302,"Checking for any decapital loss in the head, eye injuries, mouth, nose."
00:01:48.362,00:01:49.564,Negative.
00:01:49.584,00:01:50.807,"JVD, tracheal deviation."
00:01:50.986,00:01:51.346,Negative.
00:01:51.947,00:01:53.129,Any clavicle injuries?
00:01:53.734,00:01:54.195,Negative.
00:01:54.215,00:01:55.998,I'm going to also take the lung sounds here.
00:01:56.039,00:02:06.495,"Okay, no lung sounds on the right."
00:02:06.796,00:02:07.316,That's correct.
00:02:07.498,00:02:08.479,I'm going to confirm that.
00:02:08.538,00:02:10.141,I only have the chest wires on the left.
00:02:11.264,00:02:12.085,"That's correct, yep."
00:02:12.104,00:02:14.108,"Okay, so we have a possible tension pneumo."
00:02:14.127,00:02:18.635,"I'm going to stop right there and we're going to actually, I'm going to grab you the needle out of the bag there."
00:02:18.656,00:02:19.978,We're going to needle the chest here.
00:02:20.110,00:02:26.998,"I'm going to do a second intercostal space, mid-tellicular, just above the rib."
00:02:27.218,00:02:34.688,I'm actually going to need a little chest because that's expensive.
00:02:34.709,00:02:35.629,"Okay, need a little chest."
00:02:36.371,00:02:38.294,Do I hear any type of... You do.
00:02:39.556,00:02:42.900,"Okay, so I'm going to reconfer and I do have chest rise on the right side now."
00:02:42.919,00:02:43.341,You do.
00:02:43.640,00:02:45.342,Abdominal area.
00:02:45.443,00:02:46.724,Abdomen's soft.
00:02:47.686,00:02:47.786,Okay.
00:02:47.806,00:02:48.227,Pelvis.
00:02:48.493,00:02:49.395,Some instability.
00:02:49.575,00:02:51.098,"Okay, so notice I'm going to stop there."
00:02:51.299,00:02:53.181,I'm going to put a pelvic binder on my partner and my arm.
00:03:04.581,00:03:07.888,"Okay, see you partner."
00:03:11.193,00:03:12.695,The woman first when we were levitating.
00:03:21.687,00:03:23.468,A little higher.
00:03:23.489,00:03:31.897,"Perfect, okay."
00:03:31.918,00:03:32.497,"Okay, hold down."
00:03:32.557,00:03:33.618,"Okay, pelvic stabilized."
00:03:34.759,00:03:35.921,Now down on the left leg here.
00:03:36.002,00:03:37.824,Checking for any injuries.

00:03:45.972,00:03:46.072,Okay.
00:03:46.612,00:03:47.753,Start blood pressure.
00:03:48.615,00:03:49.635,Don't prep pulse.
00:03:49.656,00:03:50.676,Pulse is intact.
00:03:50.697,00:03:50.817,Okay.

00:04:05.794,00:04:15.545,"Alright, the syringes we have are the right pneumo which has been something."
00:04:16.127,00:04:17.608,It's been fixed.
00:04:18.028,00:04:19.891,We'll keep an eye on the right side in case it reinflates.
00:04:20.031,00:04:21.072,Pelvis is stabilized.
00:04:21.357,00:04:26.035,Let's go ahead and get him on a longboard and we'll get out of here.
