2025-10-15 23:24:06.427097,2025-10-15 23:24:09.050097,So we are going to facilitate a trauma scenario now.
2025-10-15 23:24:09.530097,2025-10-15 23:24:12.473097,So you can see we have a mannequin on the floor with blankets.
2025-10-15 23:24:12.493097,2025-10-15 23:24:14.095097,The blankets are supposed to be snow.
2025-10-15 23:24:14.435097,2025-10-15 23:24:21.302097,"It's not really snow, but we're hoping it's just enough to get our participants in that mindset to go with it."
2025-10-15 23:24:22.123097,2025-10-15 23:24:23.825097,"Okay, so these are the vital signs."
2025-10-15 23:24:24.466097,2025-10-15 23:24:31.253097,"And really the point of this scenario is for our responders to respond to the scene, perform an assessment."
2025-10-15 23:24:31.713097,2025-10-15 23:24:35.337097,And what they're going to find is that the patient has a pneumo.
2025-10-15 23:24:35.603097,2025-10-15 23:24:36.284097,I'll show you that again.
2025-10-15 23:24:36.324097,2025-10-15 23:24:42.572097,"Clicking on the lungs, and then clicking on pneumothorax, I can then choose which side."
2025-10-15 23:24:42.773097,2025-10-15 23:24:45.657097,"So I'm going to give them a right-sided pneumo, and then activate."
2025-10-15 23:24:46.738097,2025-10-15 23:24:50.363097,There might be some other injuries that are hard to simulate using the mannequin.
2025-10-15 23:24:50.403097,2025-10-15 23:24:58.274097,"So as the facilitator, I will be verbalizing what those are if the participants actually assess them or look for those things."
2025-10-15 23:24:59.475097,2025-10-15 23:24:59.656097,OK.
