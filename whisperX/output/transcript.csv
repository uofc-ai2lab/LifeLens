2025-10-16 21:53:45.620860,2025-10-16 21:53:48.243860,So we are going to facilitate a trauma scenario now.
2025-10-16 21:53:48.723860,2025-10-16 21:53:51.666860,So you can see we have a mannequin on the floor with blankets.
2025-10-16 21:53:51.686860,2025-10-16 21:53:53.288860,The blankets are supposed to be snow.
2025-10-16 21:53:53.628860,2025-10-16 21:54:00.495860,"It's not really snow, but we're hoping it's just enough to get our participants in that mindset to go with it."
2025-10-16 21:54:01.316860,2025-10-16 21:54:03.018860,"Okay, so these are the vital signs."
2025-10-16 21:54:03.659860,2025-10-16 21:54:10.446860,"And really the point of this scenario is for our responders to respond to the scene, perform an assessment."
2025-10-16 21:54:10.906860,2025-10-16 21:54:14.530860,And what they're going to find is that the patient has a pneumo.
2025-10-16 21:54:14.796860,2025-10-16 21:54:15.477860,I'll show you that again.
2025-10-16 21:54:15.517860,2025-10-16 21:54:21.765860,"Clicking on the lungs, and then clicking on pneumothorax, I can then choose which side."
2025-10-16 21:54:21.966860,2025-10-16 21:54:24.850860,"So I'm going to give them a right-sided pneumo, and then activate."
2025-10-16 21:54:25.931860,2025-10-16 21:54:29.556860,There might be some other injuries that are hard to simulate using the mannequin.
2025-10-16 21:54:29.596860,2025-10-16 21:54:37.467860,"So as the facilitator, I will be verbalizing what those are if the participants actually assess them or look for those things."
2025-10-16 21:54:38.668860,2025-10-16 21:54:38.849860,OK.
