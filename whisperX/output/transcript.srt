1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:02,839
So we are going to facilitate a trauma scenario now.

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,262
So you can see we have a mannequin on the floor with blankets.

3
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:07,884
The blankets are supposed to be snow.

4
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:15,092
It's not really snow, but we're hoping it's just enough to get our participants in that mindset to go with it.

5
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,614
Okay, so these are the vital signs.

6
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:25,042
And really the point of this scenario is for our responders to respond to the scene, perform an assessment.

7
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:29,126
And what they're going to find is that the patient has a pneumo.

8
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:30,074
I'll show you that again.

9
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:36,362
Clicking on the lungs, and then clicking on pneumothorax, I can then choose which side.

10
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:39,447
So I'm going to give them a right-sided pneumo, and then activate.

11
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:44,152
There might be some other injuries that are hard to simulate using the mannequin.

12
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:52,064
So as the facilitator, I will be verbalizing what those are if the participants actually assess them or look for those things.

13
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:53,445
OK.

14
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:55,148
Chart 53.

15
00:00:56,173 --> 00:01:00,500
27-year-old male, ATV rollover, no helmet, County Road 1643.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,401
Time now, 1430.

17
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:04,004
Roger that, we're on it.

18
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:15,060
Hello!

19
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,944
Alright, DSI, scene safe.

20
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:24,072
Looks like we have a 27-year-old male.

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,611
Unresponsive.

22
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:27,311
Sir, can you hear me?

23
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,875
My name is Hans with the ambulance service.

24
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:29,635
My partner, Ted.

25
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,417
Can you hear me, sir?

26
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,221
Can you hear me?

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,662
Unresponsive.

28
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:34,563
Let's get to the vitals here.

29
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:36,064
I'm going to start checking for any injuries.

30
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:40,751
My pen light, shiny eyes.

31
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:41,894
Pupils react to light?

32
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,757
Pupils are reactive to light.

33
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:48,302
Checking for any decapital loss in the head, eye injuries, mouth, nose.

34
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:49,564
Negative.

35
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:50,807
JVD, tracheal deviation.

36
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:51,346
Negative.

37
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:53,129
Any clavicle injuries?

38
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:54,195
Negative.

39
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,998
I'm going to also take the lung sounds here.

40
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:06,495
Okay, no lung sounds on the right.

41
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:07,316
That's correct.

42
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:08,479
I'm going to confirm that.

43
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,141
I only have the chest wires on the left.

44
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,085
That's correct, yep.

45
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,108
Okay, so we have a possible tension pneumo.

46
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:18,635
I'm going to stop right there and we're going to actually, I'm going to grab you the needle out of the bag there.

47
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:19,978
We're going to needle the chest here.

48
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,998
I'm going to do a second intercostal space, mid-tellicular, just above the rib.

49
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:34,688
I'm actually going to need a little chest because that's expensive.

50
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,629
Okay, need a little chest.

51
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:38,294
Do I hear any type of... You do.

52
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:42,900
Okay, so I'm going to reconfer and I do have chest rise on the right side now.

53
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,341
You do.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,342
Abdominal area.

55
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:46,724
Abdomen's soft.

56
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:47,786
Okay.

57
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:48,227
Pelvis.

58
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:49,395
Some instability.

59
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:51,098
Okay, so notice I'm going to stop there.

60
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:53,181
I'm going to put a pelvic binder on my partner and my arm.

61
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:07,888
Okay, see you partner.

62
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,695
The woman first when we were levitating.

63
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,468
A little higher.

64
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:31,897
Perfect, okay.

65
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:32,497
Okay, hold down.

66
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,618
Okay, pelvic stabilized.

67
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,921
Now down on the left leg here.

68
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,824
Checking for any injuries.

69
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:38,223
Negative.

70
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,004
Pulses?

71
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:40,385
Pulses are intact.

72
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:40,506
Okay.

73
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:41,888
Circuitry with your toes?

74
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:42,268
No response.

75
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,389
No response.

76
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:44,730
Okay, down on the other leg here.

77
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,572
Negative.

78
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:46,072
Okay.

79
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:47,753
Start blood pressure.

80
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:49,635
Don't prep pulse.

81
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:50,676
Pulse is intact.

82
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:50,817
Okay.

83
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:53,280
Left arm, same pulse.

84
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:55,823
Pulse is intact.

85
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,743
No response.

86
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,087
Right arm pulses.

87
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:00,769
Pulse is intact.

88
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,133
Blood pressure is 90 over 40.

89
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:05,615
Heart rate is 125.

90
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:15,545
Alright, the syringes we have are the right pneumo which has been something.

91
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:17,608
It's been fixed.

92
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:19,891
We'll keep an eye on the right side in case it reinflates.

93
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:21,072
Pelvis is stabilized.

94
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:26,035
Let's go ahead and get him on a longboard and we'll get out of here.
